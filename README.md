#Welcome - Still under construction

Welcome to the PascalLove2D wiki! The project aims to develop a python written, pascal based source-source compiler with the implementation of a simple API to be used for simple cross-platform application development using the pascal programming language.
Current progress



## Installation
Download or fork the project. The bin folder contains compiled binaries for many platforms or run the project directly via python -main.py [Source to translate parameters]


The project currently uses a grammar provided from the ANTLR GRAMMAR repository. The output of building this grammar file has provided a harness which is currently under active development to provide translation of the input pascal to output LUA.
Usage

To use the project download the source, ensure Python has been installed. Navigate to the python core directory and execute the following command :

Python main.py "filename.pas"
